Many formats in bioinformatics are simple tabular plain-text files delimited by a character. The most common tabular plain-text file format used in bioinformatics is tab-delimited. Bioinformatics evolved to favor tab-delimited formats because of the convenience of working with these files using Unix tools.

>>**Tabular Plain-Text Data Formats** : 
Tabular plain-text data formats are used extensively in computing. The basic format is
incredibly simple: each row (also known as a record) is kept on its own line, and each
column (also known as a field) is separated by some delimiter. There are three flavors
you will encounter: tab-delimited, comma-separated, and variable space-delimited.

## Inspecting data with `head` and `tail`

Although `cat` command is an easy way for us to open and view the content of a file, it is not very practical to do so for a file with thousands of lines as it will exhaust the shell "space". Instead, large files should be inspected first and then manipulated accordingly. First round of inspection can be done with `head` and `tail` command which prints the first 10 lines and the last 10 lines (`-n 10`) of a a file, respectively. .i.e. Let's use `head` and `tail` to inspect *Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed* 

```bash
$ head Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed 
1	3054233	3054733
1	3054233	3054733
1	3054233	3054733
1	3102016	3102125
1	3102016	3102125
1	3102016	3102125
1	3205901	3671498
1	3205901	3216344
1	3213609	3216344
1	3205901	3207317
```
```bash
$ tail Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed 
1	195166217	195166390
1	195165745	195165851
1	195165748	195165851
1	195165745	195165747
1	195228278	195228398
1	195228278	195228398
1	195228278	195228398
1	195240910	195241007
1	195240910	195241007
1	195240910	195241007
```
Changing the number of lines printed for either of those commands can be done by passing `-n <number_of_lines>` flag .i.e. Over-ride the `-n 10` default

Try those commands with `0n 4` to print top 4 lines and bottom 4 lines

```bash
$ head -n 4 Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed 
```
```bash
$ tail -n 4 Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed 
```




### Exercise 4.1
{% capture e4dot1 %}

Sometimes it’s useful to see both the beginning and end of a file — for example, if we have a sorted BED file and we want to see the positions of the first feature and last feature. Can you figure out a way to use both `head` and `tail` in a single command to inspect first and last 2 lines of ***Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed***?

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e4dot1" content=e4dot1%}

### Exercise 4.2
{% capture e4dot2 %}

We can also use tail to remove the header of a file. Normally the `-n` argument specifies how many of the last lines of a file to include, but if `-n` is given a number `x` preceded with a `+` sign (e.g., `+x` ), tail will start from the x<sup>th</sup> line. So to chop off a header, we start from the second line with `-n +2`.  Use the `seq` command to generate a file containing the numbers 1 to 10, and then use the `tail` command to chop off the first line.

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e4dot2" content=e4dot2%}



## Extract summary information with `wc` 

The "wc" in the `wc` command which stands for "word count" - this command can count the numbers of **words, lines**, and **characters** in a file (take a note on the order).

```bash
$ wc Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed 

  81226  243678 1698545 Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed
```
Often, we only need to list the number of lines, which can be done by using the `-l` flag. It can be used as a sanity check - for example, to make sure an output has the same number of lines as the input, OR to check that a certain file format which depends on another format without losing overall data structure wasn't corrupted or over/under manipulated. 

>>**Question** - count the number of lines in *Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed* and *Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf* . Anything out of the ordinary ? 

Although `wc -l` is the quickest way to count the number of lines in a file, it is not the most robust as it relies on the very bad assumption that "data is well formatted" 

For an example, If we are to create a file with 3 rows of data and then two empty lines, 

```bash
$ cat > fool_wc.bed
1 100
2 200
3 300


$
```
```bash
$ wc -l fool_wc.bed 
  5 fool_wc.bed
```
This is a good place bring in `grep` again which can be used to count the number of lines while excluding white-spaces (spaces, tabs or newlines)

```bash

$ grep -c "[^ \\n\\t]" fool_wc.bed 

  3
```
## Using  `cut` with column data and formatting tabular data with `column`

When working with plain-text tabular data formats like tab-delimited and CSV files, we often need to extract specific columns from the original file or stream. For example, suppose we wanted to extract only the start positions (the second column) of the ***Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed*** file. The simplest way to do this is with `cut`.

```bash
$ cut -f 2 Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed | head -n 3

3054233
3054233
3054233
```
>>`-f`  argument is how we specify which columns to keep. It can be used to specify a range as well

```bash

$ cut -f 2-3 Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed | head -n 3

 3054233	3054733
 3054233	3054733
 3054233	3054733
 ```
Using `cut` , we can convert our GTF for ***Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf*** to a three-column tab-delimited file of genomic ranges (e.g., chromosome, start, and end position). We’ll chop off the metadata rows using the grep command covered earlier, and then use cut to extract the first, fourth, and fifth columns (chromosome, start, end):

```bash
$ grep -v "^#" Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf | cut -f1,4,5 | head -n 3
1	3054233	3054733
1	3054233	3054733
1	3054233	3054733
```
Note that although our three-column file of genomic positions looks like a BED- formatted file, it’s not due to subtle differences in genomic range formats

`cut` also allows us to specify the column delimiter character. So, if we were to come across a CSV file containing chromosome names, start positions, and end positions, we could select columns from it, too:

As you may have noticed when working with tab-delimited files, it’s not always easy to see which elements belong to a particular column. For example:

```bash
$ grep -v "^#" Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf | cut -f1-8 | head -n3
    
    1	pseudogene	gene	3054233	3054733	.	+	.
    1	unprocessed_pseudogene	transcript	3054233	3054733	.	+	.
    1	unprocessed_pseudogene	exon	3054233	3054733	.	+	.
```

While tabs are a terrific delimiter in plain-text data files, our variable width data leads our columns to not stack up well. There’s a fix for this in Unix: program column `-t` (the `-t` option tells column to treat data as a table). column -t produces neat columns that are much easier to read:

```bash
$ grep -v "^#" Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf | cut -f 1-8 | column -t | head -n 3

    1  pseudogene                          gene         3054233    3054733    .  +  .
    1  unprocessed_pseudogene              transcript   3054233    3054733    .  +  .
    1  unprocessed_pseudogene              exon         3054233    3054733    .  +  .
```
Note that you should only use `column -t` to visualize data in the terminal, not toreformat data to write to a file. Tab-delimited data is preferable to data delimited by a
variable number of spaces, since it’s easier for programs to parse. Like `cut` , `column` ’s default delimiter is the tab character ( `\t` ). We can specify a different delimiter with the `-s` option. So, if we wanted to visualize the columns of the ***Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1_bed.csv*** file more easily, we could use:

```bash
$ column -s"," -t Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.bed | head -n 3

    1	3054233	3054733
    1	3054233	3054733
    1	3054233	3054733
```
## Sorting Plain-Text Data with Sort

Very often we need to work with sorted plain-text data in bioinformatics. The two
most common reasons to sort data are as follows:
• Certain operations are much more efficient when performed on sorted data.
• Sorting data is a prerequisite to finding all unique lines

`sort`  is designed to work with plain-text data with columns. Create a test .bed file with few rows and use `sort` command without any arguments

```bash

$ cat > test_sort.bed

chr1	26	39
chr1	32	47
chr3	11	28
chr1	40	49
chr3	16	27
chr1	9	28
chr2	35	54
chr1	10	19
```
```bash
$ sort test_sort.bed 

chr1	10	19
chr1	26	39
chr1	32	47
chr1	40	49
chr1	9	28
chr2	35	54
chr3	11	28
chr3	16	27
```
`sort` without any148
| Chapter 7: Unix Data Tools arguments simply sorts a file alphanumerically by line. Because chromosome is the first column, sorting by line effectively groups chromo‐
somes together, as these are “ties” in the sorted order.

However, using sort ’s defaults of sorting alphanumerically by line doesn’t handle tabular data properly. There are two new features we need:

- The ability to sort by particular columns

- The ability to tell sort that certain columns are numeric values (and not alpha‐numeric text)

`sort` has a simple syntax to do this. Let’s look at how we’d sort example.bed by chromosome (first column), and start position (second column):

```bash
$ sort -k1,1 -k2n test_sort.bed 

chr1	9	28
chr1	10	19
chr1	26	39
chr1	32	47
chr1	40	49
chr2	35	54
chr3	11	28
chr3	16	27
```

Here, we specify the columns (and their order) we want to sort by as `-k` arguments. In technical terms, `-k` specifies the sorting keys and their order. Each `-k` argument takes a range of columns as start,end , so to sort by a single column we use start,start . In the preceding example, we first sorted by the first column (chromosome), as the first `-k` argument was `-k1,1` . Sorting by the first column alone leads to many ties in rows
with the same chromosomes (e.g., “chr1” and “chr3”). Adding a second `-k` argument with a different column tells sort how to break these ties. In our example, `-k2,2n` tells sort to sort by the second column (start position), treating this column as numerical data (because there’s an `n` in `-k2,2n` ).


### Exercise 4.3
{% capture e4dot3 %}

***Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1_random.gtf*** file is ***Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf*** with permuted rows (and without a metadata
header). Can you group rows by chromosome, and sort by position ?. If yes, append the output to a separate file

{% endcapture %}

{% include exercise.html title="e4dot3" content=e4dot3%}

## Finding Unique Values with uniq

`uniq` takes lines from a file or standard input stream, and outputs all lines with consecutive duplicates removed. While this is a relatively simple functionality, you will use uniq very frequently in command-line data processing.

```bash
$ cat letters.txt 
A
A
B
C
B
C
C
C
```
```bash
$ uniq letters.txt 
A
B
C
B
C
```
As you can see, `uniq` does not return the unique values letters.txt—it only removes consecutive duplicate lines (keeping one). If instead we did want to find all unique lines in a file, we would first sort all lines using `sort` so that all identical lines are grouped next to each other, and then run `uniq`.

```bash
$ sort letters.txt | uniq

A
B
C
```
`uniq` with `-c` hows the counts of occurrences next to the unique lines.

```bash
$ uniq -c letters.txt 

      2 A
      1 B
      1 C
      1 B
      3 C
```
```bash
$ sort letters.txt | uniq -c

      2 A
      2 B
      4 C
```
Combined with other Unix tools like `cut`, `grep` and `sort`, `uniq` can be used to summarize columns of tabular data:

```bash
$ grep -v "^#" Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf | cut -f3 | sort | uniq -c

  25901 CDS
  36128 exon
   2027 gene
   2290 start_codon
   2299 stop_codon
   4993 transcript
   7588 UTR
```
Count in order from most frequent to last

```bash
$ grep -v "^#" Mus_musculus.GRCm38.75_chr1.gtf | cut -f3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

  36128 exon
  25901 CDS
   7588 UTR
   4993 transcript
   2299 stop_codon
   2290 start_codon
   2027 gene
```
