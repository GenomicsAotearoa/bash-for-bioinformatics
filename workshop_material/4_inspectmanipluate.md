Many formats in bioinformatics are simple tabular plain-text files delimited by a character. The most common tabular plain-text file format used in bioinformatics is tab-delimited. Bioinformatics evolved to favor tab-delimited formats because of the convenience of working with these files using Unix tools.

>>**Tabular Plain-Text Data Formats** : 
Tabular plain-text data formats are used extensively in computing. The basic format is
incredibly simple: each row (also known as a record) is kept on its own line, and each
column (also known as a field) is separated by some delimiter. There are three flavors
you will encounter: tab-delimited, comma-separated, and variable space-delimited.
