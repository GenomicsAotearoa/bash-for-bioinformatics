## Other things...

### Project environments

 - we did talk about showing how to script a project layout (e.g., consistent directory creation etc)
 - ideally you'd combine this with:
    - writing your own script
    - putting it somewhere like `~/local/bin/`
    - adding `~/local/bin/` to the `PATH`
    - we'd need to talk about `$PATH`...

### Virtual environments

- use of Python virtual environments (and `pip` etc)?
- use of `conda`?
