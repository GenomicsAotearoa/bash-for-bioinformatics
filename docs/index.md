# Setup

If possible, we do recommend using the **Remote** option over **Local**  ( Especially for *Windows* hosts). This will eliminate  the need to install any additional applications

-  **Remote** option will require an exiting NeSI Account

### Remote

??? info "Log into NeSI Mahuika Jupyter Service"

    1. Follow [https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/hub/login](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz/hub/login)
    2. <p>Enter NeSI username, HPC password and 6 digit second factor token<br>![image](./images/jupyter_login_labels_updated.png)</p>
    3. <p>Choose server options as below
    <br>>>make sure to choose the correct project code `nesi02659`, number of CPUs `CPUs=4`, memory `8 GB` prior to pressing ![images](./images/start_button.png){width="40"}  button.

### Local  :warning:



??? info "Local host setup - Windows, MacOS & Linux"

    === "Windows Hosts"

        * Install either 
          - Git for Windows from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) **OR**
          - MobaXterm Home (*Portable* or *Installer* edition) from [https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html)
              * Portable edition does not require administrative privileges 

    === "MacOS"

          * Native terminal client is sufficient.
          * It might not comes with `wget` download data via command line (can be installed with `$ brew install wget`)
          * However, it is not required as we provide a direct link to download data in .zip format 

    === "Linux"

          * Native terminal client is sufficient.

    !!! warning "`bioawk` install on all hosts"

        One of the tools used in this workshop is `bioawk` which is not native to any terminal clients. Installing it on MacOS and Linux can be done with `$ brew install bioawk` & `$ sudo apt install bioawk`, respectively.Windows hosts might have to do it via `conda` according to [these instructions](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bioawk). However, this will require a prior install of **Anaconda** Or **Miniconda**
