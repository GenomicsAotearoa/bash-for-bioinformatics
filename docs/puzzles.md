??? question "The Second Nucleic Acid"

    An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'.

    Given a DNA string *t* corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string u is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in *t* with 'U' in u

    **Given:** A DNA string *t* having length at most 1000 nt.

    **Return:** The transcribed RNA string of *t*


??? question "The secondary and tertiary structures of DNA"

    In DNA strings, symbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.

    The reverse complement of a DNA string ***s*** is the string *s^c^* formed by reversing the symbols of *s* then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of "GTCA" is "TGAC").

    **Given:** A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.

    **Return:** The reverse complement *s^c^* of *s*.
