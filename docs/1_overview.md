# Overview

!!! graduation-cap "Overall objective of the workshop"

    * Introduce few "intermediate" level linux tools, tips and tricks which can be incorporated to routine tasks while dealing with Biological data formats (or any file format)
    * It may feels like the workshops lack a story (apologies in advance) but, 
        * Methods taught here will be used in upcoming "Advanced Shell for Bioinformatics" to design "shell" based workflows (both serial and parallel)
        * And some tools are already being used in other advanced level workshops where this material can be used as a reference

    ^^NOTE^^ - some commands will have the following sub-header "Why is this useful" to list few instances where a  specific tool/command can be used in a Bioinformatics workflow
