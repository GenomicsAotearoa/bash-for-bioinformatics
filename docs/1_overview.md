# Overview

!!! graduation-cap "Overall objective of the workshop"

    * Introduce few "intermediate" level linux tools, trips and tricks which can be incorporated to routine tasks while dealing wit Biological data formats (or any file format)
    * It may feel like the workshops lack a story (apologies in advance) but, 
        * Methods taught here will be used in upcoming "Advanced Shell for Bioinformatics" to design "shell" based workflows (both serial and parallel)
        * And some tools are already being used in other advanced level workshops where this material can be used as a reference
