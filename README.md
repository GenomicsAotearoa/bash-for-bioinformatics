# Bash for Bioinformatics

This is a placeholder repository for an AMAZING workshop that Dini is putting together on Intermediate/Advanced Bash for Bioinformatics.  ðŸ˜œ

## Alright, enough kidding around...

We'll likely base the workshop on material from the book *Bioinformatics Data Skills* by Vince Buffalo.  In particular:

- Chapter 7: [Unix Data Tools](3-unix-data-tools.md)

and maybe some bits of:

- Chapter 3: [Remedial Unix Shell](draft_notes/0-remedial-unix-shell.md)
- Chapter 4: [Working with Remote Machines](draft_notes/1-remote-machines.md)
- Chapter 6: [Bioinformatics Data](draft_notes/2-bioinformatics-data.md)

and perhaps even some [other stuff](draft_notes/4-other-things.md)
