# Bash for Bioinformatics

This is a placeholder repository for an AMAZING workshop that Dini is putting together on Intermediate/Advanced Bash for Bioinformatics.  ðŸ˜œ

## Alright, enough kidding around...

We'll likely base the workshop on material from the book "Bioinformatics Data Skills" by Vince Buffalo.  In particular:

- Chapter 7: Unix Data Tools 

and maybe some bits of:

- Chapter 3: Remedial Unix Shell
- Chapter 4: Working with Remote Machines
