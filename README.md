# Bash for Bioinformatics

This is a placeholder repository for an AMAZING workshop that Dini is putting together on Intermediate/Advanced Bash for Bioinformatics.  ðŸ˜œ

## Alright, enough kidding around...

We'll likely base the workshop on material from the book "Bioinformatics Data Skills" by Vince Buffalo.  In particular:

- Chapter 7: (Unix Data Tools)[3-unix-data-tools.md]

and maybe some bits of:

- Chapter 3: (Remedial Unix Shell)[0-remedial-unix-shell.md]
- Chapter 4: (Working with Remote Machines)[1-remote-machines.md]
- Chapter 6: (Bioinformatics Data)[2-bioinformatics-data.md]

and perhaps even some (other stuff)[4-other-stuff.md]
