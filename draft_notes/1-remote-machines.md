## Working with Remote Machines

From: Chapter 4 of *Bioinformatics Data Skills* by Vince Buffalo.

### SSH

- covers `ssh` access and `~/.ssh/config` 
- ssh keys *(Is this too fiddly for this session?)*
- *Didn't mention `scp`*.

### Long running jobs

 - `nohup` and `tmux` (what about `screen`?)
 - *How much of this to cover?*
    - much of this isn't relevant if using a job scheduler.
    - But `ssh`+`screen` (okay, `ssh` + `tmux`) is SUPER-powerful if using a remote linux box.
 
### Other stuff

 - remote editing? Or just stick with local editing plus transfer with `scp`?
 - `nano` for remote edits if needed.
